# Coding Files

This folder contains all codes for this repository, all written in python.

Start at DataPreprocessing, following the instructions closely outlined in the readme.md for that folder.  This step can be skipped if you don't want to download any new data, just re-route all codes in the next step to read Data/Output/Correct/ instead of Data/Output/Local

Then move on to FigureCreation.  All figures will be exported into Figures/Local folder.  They are also provided in Figures/Correct for comparison.

The Utils folder contains custom functions written to visually simplify and streamline our analyses.  If you would like to customize any aspect of those functions, you'll do so in CustomFunctions.py.  Otherwise, you shouldn't have to bother with this folder.
